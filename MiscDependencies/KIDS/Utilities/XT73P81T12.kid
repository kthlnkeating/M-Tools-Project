This file is associated with the Log4M functionality which provides the 
"^DIC",8992.7,8992.7,"%D",2,0)
ability to include logging statements in code that can be left in when 
"^DIC",8992.7,8992.7,"%D",3,0)
released to the field.  There are several ways to control the logging, 
"^DIC",8992.7,8992.7,"%D",4,0)
but the best is through this file and using the Easy Config configuration 
"^DIC",8992.7,8992.7,"%D",5,0)
for the setup.  The functionality also includes the ability to specify 
"^DIC",8992.7,8992.7,"%D",6,0)
logging only for specific users (based on DUZ) and/or routines.  If 
"^DIC",8992.7,8992.7,"%D",7,0)
logging is specified but not turned on or only turned on for specific 
"^DIC",8992.7,8992.7,"%D",8,0)
users, the overhead is a call to the XTMLOG routine and the check for 
"^DIC",8992.7,8992.7,"%D",9,0)
existence of a specific variable which indicates that logging is active 
"^DIC",8992.7,8992.7,"%D",10,0)
for the session.  If the variable is not present, control returns 
"^DIC",8992.7,8992.7,"%D",11,0)
immediately to the calling routine.  Similarly, if a routine attempts to 
"^DIC",8992.7,8992.7,"%D",12,0)
initiate logging via reference to an entry in the file, the file entry is 
"^DIC",8992.7,8992.7,"%D",13,0)
checked  if it does not exist, or is turned off no logging is initiated.  
"^DIC",8992.7,8992.7,"%D",14,0)
